**Quick Note:**

I am uploading this because I am interested in doing front-end development. This is intended as a "portfolio piece" but you are free to download and use the code if you wish.

## Purpose/ Goal with this project:

Originally, I wanted to set out to make a mock "desktop" login screen, after being inspired by some Linux destro designs, but I ended up keeping this more a general login.
Animations on the input "focus" is done with CSS and adding a class to the elemebt by using a jquery event listener.

## Responsiveness:

Only thing that really changes is the clock position on mobile. It will appear above the login form on small screen devices.
